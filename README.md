### Hey there! üëã

First off, a HUGE thank you for stopping by! üòä

This repo is like a "hub" üõ†Ô∏è that links to all of my other portfolios. I‚Äôm constantly adding new projects, so feel free to explore and see what I'm working on! 

‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** Some of the projects are still a work in progress, and I‚Äôm updating them daily as I continue to learn and improve. Even though they‚Äôre not fully done yet, I hope you find something that resonates with you and gives you a glimpse of who I am as a coder. üöÄ
